# 🔒 Volitional Inference Gate  
_A Structural Filter for Rhetorical Override Detection in Language Model Pipelines_

## Description

The Volitional Inference Gate is a standalone structural safeguard designed to detect and block coercive, rhetorical, or authority-mimicking phrasing that may compromise interpretive freedom in language model outputs or inputs.

It operates **pre-inference**, flagging passages that attempt to override the reader’s right to question, doubt, or re-evaluate claims. This includes poetic closure commands, institutional mimicry, or statements that foreclose inquiry through drift-based persuasion.

This repository contains:
- The cloaked patent specification
- Sample flagged cases
- Output schema
- Minimal integration protocol

**This tool does not modify the LLM. It runs in parallel as a passive structural gate.**
